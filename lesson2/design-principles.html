            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
            <a href="https:www.kabelmishka.com"><img src="../lesson2/images/rsz_white-space.png" alt="a portfolio home with a bright picture in the middle of the white page"></a>
            <p class="paragraph">This gorgous portfolio's home page demonstrates a good use of white space.
                You're eyes are immediately drawn to the bright picture at the bottom, with nothing
                to distract you. This is very important as what we want to be focusing on when on this
                page is who we came here for: Kabel.

        <!--Repetition-->
        <section>
            <h3>Repetition</h3>
            <a href="https://www.picturepatchstudios.com"><img src="../lesson2/images/rsz_repitition.png" alt="a white background with pink dots showing infromation"></a>
            <p class="paragraph">Repetition is seen on this page by the nice orange circles leading your eye down the page.
                Your eyes never get tired or bored as it follows the line down to the eventual endpoint (not shown in the
                shot). And while the circles look the same, they introduce new and relavent information to the page.

        <!--Hick's Law-->
        <section>
            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com"><img src="../lesson2/images/rsz_yt.png" alt="the home page of the popular site, YouTube"></a>
            <p class="paragraph">Hick's Law is the more options their are on a page, the longer the user will
                take to make a decision or find what they are looking for. In YouTube's example, both of these
                concerns are addressed. First, the page seperates content into video types, whether they be
                shorts or full length. Then the videos are seperated by genre to better help the user narrow 
                down what to click on in YouTube's vast options.
